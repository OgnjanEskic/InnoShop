# Introduction 
Locations: This is a microservice that defines and manages the locations of the platform, such as the physical stores, warehouses, or distribution centers. 
It helps the platform to store and deliver the products to the customers, and to offer different services and options to the customers, such as shipping, 
pickup, or store visit. It communicates with other microservices, such as the order management, the inventory management, and the notification service, 
to optimize the inventory and logistics, and to reduce the costs and time.
